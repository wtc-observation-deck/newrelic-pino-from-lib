# What is this?

This is a very basic node library that uses pino under the hood.

It is used in combination with the demo-app to demonstrate logs-in-context doesn't work when pino is invoked via a library.

# Usage:

* Run `yarn` to install the required packages 
* Run `yarn build` to build the library 
* Lastly, `yarn link` to setup the library for use by yarn.

Note: You can also run `yarn clean` to delete the .next and node_modules folders.
